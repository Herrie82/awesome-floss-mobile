# Awesome FLOSS Mobile

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

We have many operating systems, apps and hardware projects, trying to push for a free/libre/open source mobile device. This page attempts to compile all these projects, state the project goals, and to give a real world review. With this you will know what to throw your support behind.

# Android

## Core Android Apps

These apps intend to replace the "core" system apps that any user would expect. These download/update apps and provide APIs for apps to use.

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Repository and app containing only FLOSS software. Has a decent selection.
* [microG](https://microg.org/) - FLOSS reimplementation of the Google Play Services middleware, a must have if you intend to run most Google Play Apps. (hard to install, you should use a pre-configured custom rom instead).
* [Yalp Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/) - Grabs APKs directly from Google Play and facilitates updates.

## Android Forks

The Android Open Source Project is licenced under Apache 2.0. However most versions ship with the proprietary Google Play Services ingrained into the OS. Which harms the user.

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) - A fork of Android with it's own set of default apps and extra features. G-Apps are optional and should be avoided if can.
* [LineageOS with microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - This fork of LineageOS is pre-configured with microG and F-Droid with the privilege extension.
* [eelo (beta)](https://e.foundation/) - New project from a veteran open-source developer/supporter, huge emphasis on privacy and control and attractiveness. It comes with microG, new default apps, account manager, new search engine and online "cloud" services.
* [Replicant](https://www.replicant.us/) - A fully FLOSS Android OS, that runs absolutely no proprietary firmware. Uses F-Droid as it's app store and is approved by the FSF. Only runs on (very) old phones.

## Essential Android Apps

Must-have apps, with direct links to either F-Droid or the APK from the official website.

*Key:* **F** = *Avalible on F-Droid*, **W** = *Only avalible from the publishers website*.

* **F** | [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - F-Droid fork of Firefox, removes proprietary bits found in Mozilla's builds.
* **W** | [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html) - The ultimate media player.
* **F** | [OpenCamera](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.sourceforge.opencamera/) - A good camera app, It's more configurable and generally takes better photos then the default camera apps.
* **F** | [Simple Gallery](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery/) - A simple gallery app, has all gallery features one would expect.
* **F** | [Amaze](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.amaze.filemanager/) - A good FLOSS file manager. Looks good, works well, and has extra features.
* **F** | [Document Viewer](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.viewer/) - Probably the best document viewer on Android. It is fast and supports PDF, DjVu, XPS and EPUB among others.
* **F** | [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/) - Powerful offline map app, shows public transport and hiking symbols among driving features.
* **F** | [Maps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.maps/) - F-Droid fork of Maps.ME. It's a fast and easy tool, but no hiking tools, and rudimentary routing.
* **F** | [Simple Calendar](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.calendar/) - A more simple solution to LineageOS and it's default app. Works well for events and has reminders.

# GNU/Linux

## GNU/Linux-based operating systems

These operating systems aren't based on Android, but are instead purpose-built GNU/Linux operating systems.

* [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) - Ubuntu ported to mobile, interesting, pleasing and gesture-based UI. Has its own [app ecosystem](https://open-store.io/). Works well on the (older but good) ["promoted devices"](https://ubports.com/devices/promoted-devices). Other devices probably won't work well if at all.
* [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) - Touch-optimized, pre-configured Alpine Linux with own packages, designed for mobile devices with the goal of keeping old phones functional and sustainable. Even if a device is supported, it may only be partial. You should check each device individually.

## GNU/Linux software

* [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/) - The KDE Plasma desktop environment ported to mobile GNU/Linux!
* [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) - Compatibility layer that allows Android apps to run on any GNU/Linux system.
