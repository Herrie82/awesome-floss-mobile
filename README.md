# Awesome FLOSS Mobile

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

We have many operating systems, apps and hardware projects, trying to push for a free/libre/open source mobile device. This page attempts to compile all these projects, state the project goals, and to give a real world review. With this you will know what to throw your support behind.

# Android

## Android Core Apps

**These apps intend to replace the "core" system apps that any user would expect. These download/update apps and provide APIs for apps to use.**

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Repository and app containing only FLOSS software. Has a decent selection.
* [microG](https://microg.org/) - FLOSS reimplementation of the Google Play Services middleware, a must have if you intend to run most Google Play Apps. (hard to install, you should use a pre-configured custom rom instead).
* [Yalp Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/) - Grabs APKs directly from Google Play and facilitates updates.

## Android Forks

**The Android Open Source Project is licenced under Apache 2.0. However most versions ship with the proprietary Google Play Services ingrained into the OS. Which harms the user.**

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) - A fork of Android with it's own set of default apps and extra features. G-Apps are optional and should be avoided if can.
* [LineageOS with microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - This fork of LineageOS is pre-configured with microG and F-Droid with the privilege extension.
* [eelo (beta)](https://e.foundation/) - New project from a veteran open-source developer/supporter, huge emphasis on privacy and control and attractiveness. It comes with microG, new default apps, account manager, new search engine and online "cloud" services.

## Android Essential Apps

**Must-have apps, with direct links to either F-Droid or APK from the official website.**

* [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - ***On F-Droid*** - F-Droid fork of Firefox, removes proprietary bits found in Mozilla's builds.
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html) - ***Not On F-Droid*** - The ultimate media player.

## Android Apps

* [Termux]

# GNU/Linux

## GNU/Linux-based operating systems

**These operating systems aren't based on Android, but are instead purpose-built GNU/Linux operating systems.**

* [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) - Ubuntu ported to mobile, interesting, pleasing and gesture-based UI. Has its own [app ecosystem](https://open-store.io/). Works well on whatever (limited) [phones](https://ubports.com/devices/promoted-devices) it has been ported to. Phone selection is good but is somewhat old.
* [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) - Touch-optimized, pre-configured Alpine Linux with own packages, designed for mobile devices with the goal of keeping old phones functional and sustainable. Device support aims to be wider then Ubuntu Touch, however all hardware features (like phone calling) doesn't work well right now.

## GNU/Linux mobile software

* KDE Plasma Mobile
* Anbox?

# Hardware

## Free Hardware Projects

* Zero Phone
