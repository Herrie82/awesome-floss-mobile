# Awesome FLOSS Mobile

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

We have many operating systems, apps and hardware projects, trying to push for a free/libre/open source mobile device. This page attempts to compile all these projects, state the project goals, and to give a real world review. With this you will know what to throw your support behind.

# Operating Systems

## Android Forks

The Android Open Source Project is licenced under Apache 2.0. However most versions ship with the proprietary Google Play Services ingrained into the OS. Which harms the user.

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) - A fork of Android with it's own set of default apps and extra features. G-Apps are optional and should be avoided if can.
* [LineageOS with microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - This fork of LineageOS is pre-configured with microG and F-Droid with the privilege extension.
* [eelo (beta)](https://e.foundation/) - New project from a veteran open-source developer/supporter, huge emphasis on privacy and control and attractiveness. It comes with microG, new default apps, account manager, new search engine and online "cloud" services.
* [Replicant](https://www.replicant.us/) - A fully FLOSS Android OS, that runs absolutely no proprietary firmware. Uses F-Droid as it's app store and is approved by the FSF. Only runs on (very) old phones.

## GNU/Linux-based operating systems

These operating systems aren't based on Android, but are instead purpose-built GNU/Linux operating systems.

* [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) - Ubuntu ported to mobile, interesting, pleasing and gesture-based UI. Has its own [app ecosystem](https://open-store.io/). Works well on whatever (limited) [phones](https://ubports.com/devices/promoted-devices) it has been ported to. Phone selection is good but is somewhat old.
* [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) - Touch-optimized, pre-configured Alpine Linux with own packages, designed for mobile devices with the goal of keeping old phones functional and sustainable. Device support aims to be wider then Ubuntu Touch, however all hardware features (like phone calling) doesn't work well right now.

# Android Apps

## Android Core Apps

These apps intend to replace the "core" system apps that any user would expect. These download/update apps and provide APIs for apps to use.

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Repository and app containing only FLOSS software. Has a decent selection.
* [microG](https://microg.org/) - FLOSS reimplementation of the Google Play Services middleware, a must have if you intend to run most Google Play Apps. (hard to install, you should use a pre-configured custom rom instead).
* [Yalp Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/) - Grabs APKs directly from Google Play and facilitates updates.

## Android Essential Apps

Must-have apps, with direct links to either F-Droid or APK from the official website.

* [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - *On F-Droid* - F-Droid fork of Firefox, removes proprietary bits found in Mozilla's builds.
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html) - *Not On F-Droid* - The ultimate media player.
* [OpenCamera](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.sourceforge.opencamera/) - *On F-Droid* - A good camera app, It's more configurable and generally takes better photos then the default camera apps.
* [Simple Gallery](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery/) - *On F-Droid* - A simple gallery app, has all gallery features one would expect.
* [Amaze](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.amaze.filemanager/) - *On F-Droid* - A good FLOSS file manager. Looks good, works well, and has extra features.
* [Document Viewer](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.viewer/) - *On F-Droid* - Probably the best document viewer on Android. It is fast and supports PDF, DjVu, XPS and EPUB among others.
* [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/) - *On F-Droid* - Powerful offline map app, shows public transport and hiking symbols among driving features.
* [Maps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.maps/) - *On F-Droid* - F-Droid fork of Maps.ME. It's a fast and easy tool, but no hiking tools, and rudimentary routing.
* [Simple Calendar](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.calendar/) - *On F-Droid* - A more simple solution to LineageOS and it's default app. Works well for events and has reminders.
